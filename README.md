# Summer 2023 SSU Genetech Bias Research Project
A series of files relating to the 2023 summer Genetech Research Project on assessing and mitigating bias within deep learning based skin cancer detection and classification.

This project was in colaboration with Sloan Howard and Dr. Gurman Gill at Sonoma State University.

However, since this project dealt with a great deal of medical data, many files which involved processing and analyzing that data have not been uploaded in order to preserve the privacy of that data. Further, I have only included the files or results that I directly worked on myself. All work on this project that was not my own has not been included in this repository. This includes the project's paper and informational poster (done by Sloan Howard) and other files she worked on. If you are interested in seeing any of the files which I have not publicly released or the paper/informational poster, email me and I can send them to you.

**Important Notes**:
1. While much of this material contains the actual testing code which was used during our research, it was also meant to serve as learning material.
2. All of this work was completed using Google Colab, and thus contains some extra code to handle file management in that environment.
3. These files have been altered for this public release, so that sensitive data is not released. This includes removing the output of various cells, as well as removing sections of code of the preset values of variables. When variables are unset, they are set to "None", and when code is removed, ample comments are provided to explain what changes were made and what to do to run that section without error.
4. If you wish to run any of these programs and encounter errors in any way, send me an email and I will be happy to lend you any assistance that I can.
