# Genetech-Bias-Research-Project
A series of files relating to the 2023 summer Genetech Research Project on assessing and mitigating bias within deep learning based skin cancer detection and classification.

This project was in colaboration with Sloan Howard and Dr. Gurman Gill at Sonoma State University.

While much of this material contains the actual testing code which was used during our research, it was also meant to serve as learning material. Also, all of 
our work was completed using Google Colab, and thus contains some extra code to handle file management in that environment.
