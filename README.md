# Genetech-Bias-Research-Project

This project was in colaboration with Sloan Howard and Dr. Gurman Gill at Sonoma State University.

**Important Notes**:
1. While much of this material contains the actual testing code which was used during our research, it was also meant to serve as learning material.
2. All of this work was completed using Google Colab, and thus contains some extra code to handle file management in that environment.
3. These files have been altered for this public release, so that sensitive data is not released. This includes removing the output of various cells, as well as removing sections of code of the preset values of variables. When variables are unset, they are set to "None", and when code is removed, ample comments are provided to explain what changes were made and what to do to run that section without error.
4. If you wish to run any of these programs and encounter errors in any way, send me an email and I will be happy to lend you any assistance that I can.
